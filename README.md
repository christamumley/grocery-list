# grocery-list
This is a python script that allows you to choose a recipe contained in the recipes directory. 
It will return similar recipes to the one you chose, by number of shared ingredients, and generate a shopping list based off of it, with 
the necessary ingredients and the amounts needed.

Entry point is main.py. Outputs the list to output.txt. Recipes in the recipes directory are .txt files that are named the recipe name. Recipes will ignore any line that starts with "link " or "# ".
